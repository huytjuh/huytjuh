### Featured Projects üèÜ

#### **Incorporating Subsequence Time-Series Clustering in LSTM, lightGBM, RF, Fourier-ARIMA, and Hybrid models on daily TV ratings of American TV-channels**
Extending the state-of-the-art Time-Series forecasting models by utilizing a data-driven anomaly detection and complex seasonality clustering approach using Self-Organizing Map and Hierarchical Clustering methods. Results showed significant improvements on the existing forecasting models based on a 1-year-ahead prediction of multiple time-series of over 10 TV-channels.\
